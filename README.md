# 🧠 AI-Powered RAG Chatbot for Website Knowledge Base
A domain specific AI chatbot that answers questions about a website using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, **FAISS**, and **Ollama's Mistral LLM**. It scrapes website content, stores it in a vector database, and provides context aware responses via a **Streamlit** UI.
> 📌 **Key Use Case**: Build a private chatbot that deeply understands your website and provides reliable, context aware responses.

## 📈 How It Works
1. Scrape website content from a provided URL.
2. Chunk and embed text into FAISS for fast retrieval.
3. Answer user questions using RAG (retrieve relevant chunks, generate responses with Mistral).
4. Display results in a Streamlit UI with chat history.

**Example**:
Let’s say you want to create a chatbot for your company’s product documentation site. You run this app with your URL:

```

[https://your-website.com/docs/](https://your-website.com/docs/)

````

Then your customers can ask questions like:

- "How do I reset my password?"
- "What are the system requirements for installation?"

The chatbot searches your site content and provides accurate, AI generated answers all while keeping data private.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting
- **Ollama not running**: Start with `ollama serve`.
